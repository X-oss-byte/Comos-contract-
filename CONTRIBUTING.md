# Contributing

We are glad you're interested in contributing to `themis-contract`!
Contributions are most welcome.

There are two principles ways to contribute at this point:

- [File an issue][] with a bug report or feature request.
- Contribute to the source code (including documentation).

## Contributing to the source

We require that all commits be signed, certifying the [Developer Certificate
of Origin (DCO)][DCO]. By signing your commits you confirm that you wrote
your contribution, or have otherwise secured the right to contribute the
contribution as an open-source addition to our project.

You can sign your commits automatically by using the `--signoff` (or `-s`) flag
when you commit:

```sh
git commit -s -m 'Some commit message'
```

Or manually, by including a line with your name and email in each commit
message, following this pattern:

```
Some commit message

Signed-off-by: Some Name <some.name@fake.example.org>
```
