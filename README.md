# Themis Contract ðŸ–‹

**PROTOTYPE**: Note that `themis-contract` is a prototype right now. All code on
this branch is to be considered highly experimental. No semantic versioning will
be used just yet: at present, a `v0.2.x` series is being released. Breaking
changes can be released at any time (including complete rewrites in another
programming language).

If you're looking for the TypeScript-based prototype, it's currently on the
`master` branch.

## Overview

Themis Contract is a prototype tool to help with legal contracting. It aims to
make legal contracts somewhat more modular and executable than they
traditionally are.
